# IceySchuy
The IceySchuy (Iceyâ€”Sky) bot was created to compile all the NWHL news in one place. To start, this bot will only retweet the NWHL and official team accounts, but later on, media members and other officials may be added. This bot was created in Python with Tweepy and the Twitter API.  To view more: https://www.schuylermeyer.com/tweetingaccounts To view the bot in action: https://twitter.com/IceySchuy
